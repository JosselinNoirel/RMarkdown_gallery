## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see the RStudio website^[Here's the [link](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)].

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
datatable(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", }
qplot(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure)
```

You can also embed plots, for example. Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
